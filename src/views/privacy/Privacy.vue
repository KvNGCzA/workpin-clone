      <p class="content">
        We at workpin Ltd are committed to maintaining the trust and confidence
        of our visitors to our web site. In particular, we want you to know that
        workpin is not in the business of selling, renting or trading email
        lists with other companies and businesses for marketing purposes. We
        just don’t do that sort of thing. But just in case you don’t believe us,
        in this Privacy Policy, we’ve provided lots of detailed information on
        when and why we collect your personal information, how we use it, the
        limited conditions under which we may disclose it to others and how we
        keep it secure.

      <p class="content">
        When someone visits <a href="https://www.workpin.ai">workpin.ai</a> we
        use third party services, such as Hubspot and Google Analytics, to
        collect standard internet log information and details of visitor
        behaviour patterns. We do this to find out things such as the number of
        visitors to the various parts of the site. This information is only
        processed in a way which does not identify anyone. We do not make, and
        do not allow Google to make, any attempt to find out the identities of
        those visiting our website.

        As part of the registration process when you contact
        <a href="mailto:team@workpin.ai">team@workpin.ai</a>, we collect
        personal information. We use that information for a couple of reasons:
        to tell you about stuff you’ve asked us to tell you about; to contact
        you if we need to obtain or provide additional information; to check our
        records are right and to check every now and then that you’re happy and
        satisfied. We don't rent or trade email lists with other organisations
        and businesses.
